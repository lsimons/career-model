  <p>
    ArchiMate is a heavyweight formal specification for architecture that is used mostly in large organizations.
    It is best avoided for small- to medium-sized projects, where lightweight approaches such as
    [Software Production > Architecture > C4] are sufficient. You should learn ArchiMate "on the job" when you
    encounter a context in which its use is mandated.

    You can gain official accreditation for ArchiMate from The Open Group. If you are working in a context where
    ArchiMate is required, the certification training and certification exam may be worth it.

    If you do not need to conform to ArchiMate specification, investing in its rigorous application is typically a lot
    of effort for limited benefit. Architecture diagrams are communication tools to capture the important
    characteristics of a software system, and whether they do so effectively is generally more important than that they
    do so in compliance with a specification such as ArchiMate.
